### Identify the Bug

If there is not yet an issue for your bug, please open a new issue and link it here. You can find templates to open an issue [here](https://github.com/JazzBrotha/screenmycode/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
Note: One person's "bug" may be another person's "feature". If the pull request does not address an existing issue with a "bug" label, it may not be treated as such. -->
