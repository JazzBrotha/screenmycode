# screenmycode [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/JazzBrotha/screenmycode.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/JazzBrotha/screenmycode)

**The project is currently under development. The initial release plans to launch the 12:th of December 2018.**

This web application is an accessibility tool to help developers learn the fundamentals of screen reader mechanics. The application contains a sandbox where the user can drop a piece of code, and as the user navigates through the code, the screen reader highlights the part of the code that is being read. This serves to demonstrate how the screen reader interacts with the source code through the Web Accessibility API. A wireframe will be added to describe the application flow more clearly.

The server side of the application runs on [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), and the client side runs on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). You can find information about the application's development technologies in the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
