# screenmycode

**The project is currently under development. The initial release plans to launch the 12:th of December 2018.**

This web application is an accessibility tool for developers to help them learn the fundamentals of screen readers mechanics. The application contains a sandbox where the user can drop a piece of code, and as the user navigates through the code, the part of the code that the screen reader reads is highlighted. A wireframe will be added to describe the application flow more cleary.

The application is part of [Mozilla Open Leaders Round 6](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/).
